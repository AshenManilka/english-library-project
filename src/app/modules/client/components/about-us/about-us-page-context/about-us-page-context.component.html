      <p>
          We are delighted to introduce this series of Grammar and Spoken English publications, designed to benefit school children and school leavers dedicated to learning English. We recognize that one of the major challenges they face is the lack of English books or publications that offer a consistent schedule of grammar lessons. To address this issue, we have organized our grammar lessons in a structured manner, ensuring they are easy for students to understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another significant challenge we have identified is the scarcity of English books or publications that provide necessary Sinhala explanations. To overcome this, each lesson in our publications includes essential Sinhala clarifications. We hope you find these publications highly useful. We wish you all the best in your learning journey.
